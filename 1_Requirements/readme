In many conditions, the conventional liquid data monitoring based on an ultrasonic sensor
provides the unreliable readings due to the dynamically changed water level.
In addition, in some conditions, it needs not only measuring water level but also needs to measure the volume and control water surplus or deficiency. 
To solve these issues,an accurate non-contact water measurement system based on a microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the level 
and volume of liquids in small tanks without any contact.
