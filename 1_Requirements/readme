#Introduction
The water and wastewater industry has many requirements for measuring the level of water in applications such as flumes, weirs, pipes, tanks, wells, basins, and cooling towers. Ultrasonic sensors are reliable, cost-effective instruments for these applications. In operation, the sensor is mounted over the water. 
To determine the distance to the water, it transmits a sound pulse that reflects from the surface of the water and measures the time it takes for the echo to return.

## Reasearch
In many conditions, the conventional liquid data monitoring based on an ultrasonic sensor
provides the unreliable readings due to the dynamically changed water level.
In addition, in some conditions, it needs not only measuring water level but also needs to measure the volume and control water surplus or deficiency. 
To solve these issues,an accurate non-contact water measurement system based on a microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the level 
and volume of liquids in small tanks without any contact.
